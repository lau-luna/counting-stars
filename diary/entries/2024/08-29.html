                        <p>
                            This day I am actually writing it on Friday, because I was very tired and laziness overcame
                            me. This morning I went to school, and as has happened to me before, I was there alone
                            wondering why no one else was coming. After the flag was raised and everyone went to their
                            classrooms, I ran into my Database teacher. He asked me why I was alone, and I asked him if
                            the FCT professor was missing. Sure enough, I got hung up again. So I had to go home, and it
                            turned out that the parents' group had warned me, but mom didn't tell me anything because
                            she thought I already knew about it. No drama, it happens. Later, around 10 o'clock, I
                            started to feel sleepy and I was like that all day.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            In the morning, I was recording a demo of a new song for common bastards. In the afternoon I
                            went to class, continued with the olympiad work, went home to work and everything was pretty
                            normal. Today I didn't feel like cycling at all, plus my legs were pretty sore. At night, I
                            played a couple of games of garou with Yesica, then, sleep got the better of me and I fell
                            asleep quite early.
