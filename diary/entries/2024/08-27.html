                        <p>
                            I am writing this while listening to a bit of <a href="https://youtu.be/tyfXw0m8-5Y?t=1489"
                                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nihilismo</a>. I have always had the idea of
                            keeping a personal
                            diary, perhaps to leave a record of my experiences so that my future self can see this and
                            have proof that I really existed. Or it could also be to remember how young I was and to
                            feel a bit nostalgic, as I have always liked.
                        </p>

                            I just came back from a bike ride, just like I started doing again yesterday. Since my bike
                            was fixed, I took the opportunity to resume a habit I had around this time last year, to
                            improve my health a bit and all that. When I passed by several kiosks, I felt the vicious
                            urge to buy a can of alcohol, or even cigarettes, and Iâ€™m not even a smoker. Perhaps it's
                            that walking alone at those hours, in winter, when only a few are returning from work, or
                            some misguided like me are wandering around, makes me feel a bit melancholic. The thing is, I
                            didn't have any money, nor my phone to transfer. It's not exactly a good idea to drink on a
                            Tuesday, especially when I'm trying to minimize my bad habits and improve physically.

                            Today was a bit of a tiring day at school. At least we laughed a little during the
                            entrepreneurship hour when the teacher reviewed our Word draft and the title said "Based Business
                            Plans". Later that class, I learned to play Tripeaks solitaire.
