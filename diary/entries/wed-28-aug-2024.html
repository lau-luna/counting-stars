                            This is another day writing here; it seems that Iâ€™m finally going to get the hang of this
                            habit. Today work was normal, and school was too. I went to visit my grandmother and had
                            lunch there with her and my cousin; they are both doing well. It seems that I finished
                            programming the project I'm working on for the computer science Olympics; I just have the
                            folder part left and that's it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I received a message from a special person, to whom I had to send an image that I forgot to
                            take to school this afternoon. This person was the only romantic relationship I ever had,
                            but we never became anything official. I have had good experiences and bad ones as well. The
                            thing is, it was about their apology for what happened four years ago between us. I found
                            their words quite sweet and sincere, so I took the opportunity to be honest as well and let
                            them know that everything is fine. I sincerely appreciated the action they took. I am glad
                            that things are going well for them, and that we were able to have a mature conversation
                            with everything we have learned during this time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While riding my bike,
                            many thoughts crossed my mind; about the past, and about silly ideas here and there. I
                            wonder why, at my age, I am such a negative and inflexible person, gloomy and reclusive.
                            Sometimes I think that people are afraid of me or see me as quite a strange guy; it might be
                            because I'm rather serious, and they don't usually find me outside of my home. Although it's
                            true that I am quite eccentric, it's part of my personality. It doesn't matter what they may
                            think of me; I have no need to hide who I am. Many times I feel that growing up and becoming
                            an adult is turning into the doomer meme.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am fulfilling my goal of riding my bike every
                            day, and I am happy about that. I also feel quite anxious about submitting the work for the
                            Olympics, and I am very excited about the possibility of advancing to the national stage.
                            I'm
                            going to take a shower, have dinner, and go to bed to play <strong>Riviera: The Promised Land</strong> until
                            I fall asleep.
